# LED Mapper application units, declared via sbc-deploy's generic
# `services.sbcApps` module. The two long-lived Pi processes from the design doc
# §3:
#   * led-driver (M1) — owns the SPI bus + pattern clock (realtime).
#   * led-server (M2) — FastAPI/uvicorn web server; depends on the driver's
#     control socket, binds :80, serves the web app.
#
# PLACEHOLDER PACKAGES: M1/M2 are Bazel-built (Python + the native Rust solver)
# and not yet packaged for Nix, so `package` points at inert stubs. When they
# land, swap in the real derivations — the unit shape, service user, dirs,
# capabilities, and firewall openings here are already correct.
